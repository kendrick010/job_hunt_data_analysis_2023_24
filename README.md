## About

Since early July 2023, I have been constantly working on this project called applying for summer internships. For anyone, this is not a fun process as it is a draining and demoralizing to see follow-ups entailing the words "we have decided to pursue a different candidate" or "we will not be moving forward with your application". The internship application process is a brutal process for students around this time in Fall, especially with how the job market not being so well.

For roughly 4.5 months, I have been pushing myself to apply for summer internships everyday. Just to briefly highlight how competitive job hunting is, I had to apply to 1,964 summer internship applications within the span of roughly 4.5 months to finally receive one acceptance. Because of the vast number of applications, I also received a fair amount of behavioral/technical calls and interviews. However, as expected, all of these either resulted in rejections or a "ghost".

By no means my shared experience is intended to intimidate nor discourage anyone from applying to summer roles. I made this repository to shed light and insight based on my education and career background. Hopefully, people in a similar boat as me can take away something helpful from this repository.

Some context about me during my job hunt, I am a fourth year student at UCSD majoring in Electrical Engineering and minoring in Cognitive Science. My career goal is to pursue something in software development or data science. The majority of internship roles I applied to were within the tech and software track, yet the tech job market is ridiculously saturated and competitive. The odds definitely felt against me, especially coming from a non-CS background. In fact, the one acceptance I received was a quality engineering intern role at Texas Instruments. I also used [Simplify's Summer2024-InternshipsPublic](https://github.com/SimplifyJobs/Summer2024-Internships) repository which was THE ultimate curated job listing site for tech internships.

Some advice on applying for internships:
- I heavily recommend referrals after this massacre.
- Create a spreadsheet to track applications.
- When ecountering a job post for a company, do not just apply to that single post. Also visit the company's website and career page to find more openings.
- Many applications template from Workday and Smartr. Use browser extensions like Simplify to automate your applications.
- Do not hold high hopes for a single application. Instead, focus on consistently applying for many applications to broaden your chances. Job hunting really is a biased numbers game unfortunately.

## Getting Started

I recorded all of my job applications based on company name, status, date, position, etc. on a Google Sheets. However, I mostly lazily categorized my applications with either an `applied` or a `rejected` status. To the data analysis more useful, I also want to consider for applications that proceeded with interviews, including ongoing and rejected applications. ~~Although I could spend an hour manually searching through my email inbox to find and edit which applications proceeded with interviews, I am instead going to spend a week developing a script to scrape and filter my inbox.~~ (*I realized this could easily be done by looking at my email confirmations for interviews in my sent inbox and filtering for keywords, such as "interview", "noreply", or "applying", in my received inbox.*)
